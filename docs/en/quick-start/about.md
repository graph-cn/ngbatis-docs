## How to position ngbatis
**NGBATIS**  is a database ORM framework base [Nebula Graph](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula) + springboot. Take advantage of [mybatis'](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3) usage habits to develop. Including some frequently-used  operation in single table and vertex-edge, like [mybatis-plus](https://github.com/baomidou/mybatis-plus).
If you prefer JPA, [graph-ocean](https://github.com/nebula-contrib/graph-ocean) is a good choice.
